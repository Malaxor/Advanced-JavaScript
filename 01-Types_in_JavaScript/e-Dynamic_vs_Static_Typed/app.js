// JavaScript is a dynamically typed language
// this means that we don't have to specify the type of variable (number, boolean, string, null, undefined)
let me = "Philip" 
let age = 36;
let single = true;
// the data type stored in the variable is implicitly understood by the engine

// In a statically typed language, the variable type has to be explicitly declared (ex: Java, C++)

// Static typed languages usually have fewer bugs but are more laborious to implement
// Dynamic typed languages are more flexible and allows for faster programming
